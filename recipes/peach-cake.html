			<p class="description content">A moist, light peach cake is topped with a sugary sweet, praline-like icing for a decadent dessert. Since this recipe starts with boxed cake mix and canned peaches, you can make it easily any time of year, not just when peaches are in season! Replace the icing with a crumble topping for a more coffee cake-like variation.</p>

			<h4 class="directions head">Directions</h4>
				<h5 class="steps-head">Step1</h5>
					<p class="directions content">Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 13x9-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray.</p>
				<h5 class="steps-head">Step2</h5>
					<p class="directions content">Drain juice from the cans of peaches into a measuring cup until you have 1/2 cup of peach juice. Set aside the 1/2 cup of peach juice and discard remaining juice.</p>
				<h5 class="steps-head">Step3</h5>
					<p class="directions content">Chop peaches and pat with paper towels to remove some of the excess moisture. Add chopped peaches to a small mixing bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of the cake mix.</p>
				<h5 class="steps-head">Step4</h5>
					<p class="directions content">In a large mixing bowl, beat remaining cake mix, eggs, oil, and 1/2 cup reserved peach juice with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle chopped peaches evenly over batter. </p>
				<h5 class="steps-head">Step5</h5>
					<p class="directions content">Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (a few moist crumbs are okay), 28 to 33 minutes. Allow cake to begin cooling on a wire rack while you prepare icing.</p>
				<h5 class="steps-head">Step6</h5>
					<p class="directions content">Place brown sugar, butter, and cream in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved, 10 to 15 minutes from the time you first turned on the heat. Stir in vanilla until well mixed, then remove from heat.</p>
				<h5 class="steps-head">Step7</h5>
					<p class="directions content">Gradually whisk in confectioners' sugar until smooth.</p>
				<h5 class="steps-head">Step8</h5>
					<p class="directions content">Immediately pour icing over warm cake, and spread quickly with a spatula into an even layer, as icing will set quickly.</p>
